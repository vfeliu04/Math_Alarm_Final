# Math_Alarm_Final
This app was created in 2019, it isn't published it was made using MIT App Inventor (Block coding). 


I made this application back when I was 15 years old for a high school project in Introduction to Computer Science. The application is quite simple to use the user has three alarms which they can set (As seen below by figure 1) and they can choose the difficulty of the math problem. Math 1 being addition. Math 2 being multiplication. Math 3 being division of small numbers. When the alarm goes off the user has to solve the math problem correctly in order to stop the alarm. I have also included the documentation I did for the project back in 2019.
